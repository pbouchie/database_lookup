# database_lookup
This is a small script I wrote whilst working at Johnson and Johnson and retrieves information from a centrally located Excel database file (mapped network drive). I could not include the database file as it contains all our protein sequences and is therefor highly confidential. The script looks up the requested (construct_input file) lotnumbers of the DNA and the location in the freezer. This information is used to document research results while doing high-throughput screening assays.
